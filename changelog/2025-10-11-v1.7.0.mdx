## ✨ New Features

### Script Loader

We're deprecating the tracking blocker and replacing it with a new approach to managing script loading based on consent.

The [script loader](/docs/frameworks/javascript/script-loader) will handle the loading, unloading and life cycle of all scripts based on consent. 

To make using the script loader easier, we've added a new `@c15t/scripts` package that contains prebuilt scripts for common analytics and marketing tools as well as introduced [integration guides](/docs/integrations) for integrating c15t with your tools such as Google Tag Manager (GTM) and PostHog.

```ts
import { ConsentManagerProvider } from '@c15t/react';
import { googleTagManager } from '@c15t/scripts/google-tag-manager';

export function App({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <ConsentManagerProvider options={{
      scripts: [
        googleTagManager({
          id: 'GTM-XXXXXXX',
        }),
        {
          id: 'example',
          src: 'https://analytics.example.com/script.js',
          category: 'analytics',
        }
      ]
    }}>
      {children}
    </ConsentManagerProvider>
  );
}
```

⚠️ **Heads-up:** the current tracking blocker will be removed in c15t v2.0. It is automatically disabled when using the script loader in v1.7.0.

See the [Script Loader documentation](/docs/frameworks/react/script-loader) for full details.

### iFrame Blocking

Stopping iframes such as YouTube embeds from loading until consent is given is important for privacy and compliance. This update introduces two new ways to block iframes:

- Frame Component (React - Recommended): This is a React component that conditionally renders content and provides a pre-built/customizable placeholder providing great UX. [Learn more about the Frame component](/docs/frameworks/react/components/frame)
- Headless: This is a headless implementation that does not render any DOM elements. It only manages the src/data-src attributes of existing iframe elements.

```ts
import { Frame } from '@c15t/react';

export function App({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <Frame category="marketing" className="aspect-video w-full">
      <iframe
        title="Cool Duck Video"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mQJ6q1ZCzsg"
        width="100%"
        height="100%"
      />
    </Frame>
  );
}
```

See the [iFrame Blocking documentation](/docs/frameworks/react/iframe-blocking) for full details.

## Dynamic Consent Categories

Consent categories are now dynamic and update based on the content of the page. For example, if you set the categories to `['necessary', 'marketing']` but there is an script (via the script loader) with the category `['experience']`, the consent banner will show the `experience` category as well.

This logic is applied to the iframe blocking as well via the `data-category` attribute and the Frame component in React.

## New Examples!

We've moved our examples to a new repository, [c15t-examples](https://github.com/c15t/c15t-examples). As well as added more detailed examples instead of barebones examples.

Currently the in-depth examples are only available for the React & Next.js frameworks but we'll be updating the JavaScript examples soon.
