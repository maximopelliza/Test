## Minor Changes

- feat(core, react): added `ignoreGeoLocation` to provider and store to allow showing the cookie banner during development regardless of geo. Also improved provider props with a new `consentCategories` option (DX-friendly alias for `store.initialGDPRTypes`). ([c7b4ad5](https://github.com/c15t/c15t/commit/c7b4ad5be23baba27c8f97af8c5aec85527986a3))
- feat(core): added `config` prop on the store for better debugging and inspection. ([6eb9a8d](https://github.com/c15t/c15t/commit/6eb9a8d044ecb3cc74fa8e70f60bb9dfac6318bb))

## Patch Changes

- fix(react): add `aria-label` to the cookie banner component to improve accessibility. ([ed5092e](https://github.com/c15t/c15t/commit/ed5092edbc65d1762a1ada37bf50ab61dc8d6046))
- fix(cli): remove unnecessary env import during onboarding for Next.js config generation. ([6eb9a8d](https://github.com/c15t/c15t/commit/6eb9a8d044ecb3cc74fa8e70f60bb9dfac6318bb))
- fix(cli): resolved duplicate package manager prompt during setup. ([37ef4c5](https://github.com/c15t/c15t/commit/37ef4c53c511eb74e3faa4de68ad7876158fa807))
- chore(core/react): small cleanup and provider/store prop alignment. ([e30ffaf](https://github.com/c15t/c15t/commit/e30ffafe872eefe883384d07e1da07ae81660e23))
- chore: additional housekeeping and consistency updates. ([169de72](https://github.com/c15t/c15t/commit/169de720fcd745e5759685f694dbb9a373dbcc96))

## Updated Dependencies

- Updated dependencies [6eb9a8d]
  - `@c15t/react@1.4.0`

## Usage Notes

- To force the cookie banner to appear during local development outside of regulated regions, enable `ignoreGeoLocation`.
- Prefer `consentCategories` over `store.initialGDPRTypes` for a clearer provider-level configuration.

```tsx
<ConsentManagerProvider
  options={{
    mode: 'c15t',
    backendURL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_C15T_URL,
    ignoreGeoLocation: true,
    consentCategories: ['necessary', 'analytics', 'marketing'],
  }}
/>
```

- Use the store `config` prop to inspect or log runtime settings for debugging.

```ts
createConsentManagerStore({
  config: { verbose: true },
});
```
