  ## How It Works

  <Callout type="note">
    Offline mode provides the same API interface as the standard client but operates completely client-side.
  </Callout>

  The offline mode implements the same interface as the standard client, but with the following differences:

  1. **Storage**: All consent preferences are stored in the browser's localStorage using the configured key
  2. **Network**: No network requests are made, all operations happen locally
  3. **Consent Banner**: The banner visibility is determined by checking if a value exists in localStorage
  4. **Consent Verification**: Always returns a successful response
