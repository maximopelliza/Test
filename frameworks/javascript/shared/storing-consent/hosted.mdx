  ## Managed Service vs Self-Hosting

  Using [consent.io](https://consent.io) is the easiest way to get started with c15t. It's a fully managed service that removes all the infrastructure complexity. You can focus on your application while we handle scaling, updates, and compliance monitoring. For organizations with specific requirements, we also offer [self-hosting](/docs/self-host/v2) options.
